### The Impact on the League
The practice of tanking can have far-reaching consequences for the league. It can lead to a lack of competitiveness in games, which can negatively impact fan engagement and interest. Furthermore, tanking can also create an uneven playing field, where teams that are not tanking are at a disadvantage.

#### The Role of Fans and Media
Fans and media play a crucial role in holding teams accountable for tanking. By speaking out against the practice and supporting teams that compete at a high level, fans and media can help to create a culture that values competitiveness and integrity.

## Conclusion
