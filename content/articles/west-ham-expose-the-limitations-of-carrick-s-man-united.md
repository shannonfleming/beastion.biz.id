# Introduction
Manchester United's recent form has been impressive, with four wins in a row, but their latest match against West Ham has exposed some limitations in Carrick's squad. A point on the road is not a bad result, but the draw has highlighted issues with breaking down a packed defence.

# The Match
The match against West Ham was always going to be a tough test for Manchester United. West Ham is a well-organized team that is difficult to break down, and they proved it once again on Tuesday. Manchester United had the majority of possession, but they struggled to create clear-cut chances.

| Team | Possession | Shots | Shots on Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manchester United | 65% | 15 | 5 |
| West Ham | 35% | 8 | 2 |

# Limitations Exposed
The draw against West Ham has exposed some limitations in Carrick's squad. Manchester United struggled to break down a packed defence, and they lacked a cutting edge in the final third. This is not the first time that Manchester United has struggled against a team that defends deep, and it is an issue that Carrick needs to address.

# Lack of Creativity
One of the main issues for Manchester United was a lack of creativity in midfield. They struggled to create chances through the middle, and they relied too heavily on crosses into the box. This is an area where Manchester United needs to improve, as they need to be able to break down teams that defend deep.

# Conclusion
The draw against West Ham is not a bad result, but it has highlighted some limitations in Carrick's squad. Manchester United needs to work on breaking down teams that defend deep, and they need to improve their creativity in midfield. If they can address these issues, they will be a more formidable team in the long run.

# Future Outlook
The future outlook for Manchester United is still positive, despite the draw against West Ham. They have a talented squad, and they have the potential to achieve great things. However, they need to work on their weaknesses and improve their overall game. If they can do this, they will be a force to be reckoned with in the Premier League.

# Key Statistics
