### Narrative
The stage is set for an exciting showdown between Manchester United and West Ham in the Premier League. As the Red Devils look to continue their winning streak, Erik ten Hag has announced his starting lineup. The team will be led by captain Harry Maguire, with David de Gea in goal. The midfield will feature the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen, while the attack will be spearheaded by Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.

### Battle
The match is expected to be a closely contested one, with both teams looking to secure all three points. West Ham, led by manager David Moyes, will be looking to cause an upset and take advantage of any mistakes made by the Manchester United defense. The Hammers have been in good form of late, with their recent win over Liverpool a testament to their growing confidence. However, Manchester United will be looking to assert their dominance and prove why they are one of the top teams in the league.

### Turning Point
One of the key factors that could determine the outcome of the match is the performance of Manchester United's midfield. If Fernandes and Eriksen can control the tempo of the game and provide ample opportunities for the attack, the Red Devils may be able to overpower West Ham. On the other hand, if the Hammers can manage to neutralize the threat posed by Manchester United's midfield, they may be able to catch their opponents off guard and secure a surprise win.

### Data Table
The statistics suggest that Manchester United have a slight edge over West Ham. The Red Devils have won 55% of their matches against the Hammers, while West Ham have managed to secure a win in only 25% of their encounters. However, the recent form of both teams suggests that the match could go either way. Manchester United have won 60% of their last 10 matches, while West Ham have secured a win in 50% of their last 10 encounters.
