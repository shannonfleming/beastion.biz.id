# Chelsea's Woes Continue: Ten-Men Blues Drop Points to Burnley

Chelsea's struggles to hold onto leads in the Premier League continued on Saturday as they dropped points to Burnley at Stamford Bridge. The Blues, who had taken the lead, were left stunned after Zian Flemming's 93rd-minute header earned Burnley a 1-1 draw.

## The Game Unfolds

The match started with Chelsea dominating possession, but it was the sending off of Wesley Fofana that changed the complexion of the game. Despite being a man down, Chelsea managed to hold onto their lead for most of the game. However, Burnley's persistence paid off in the dying minutes of the match.

## A Familiar Story for Chelsea

This result marks the 17th time this season that Chelsea has dropped points from a winning position in the Premier League. The Blues' inability to close out games has been a recurring theme, and it's a concern that manager Graham Potter will need to address.

## Burnley's Late Surge

Burnley's equalizer was a testament to their never-say-die attitude. The visitors had been pushing for an equalizer throughout the second half, and their efforts finally paid off in the 93rd minute. Flemming's header was a culmination of Burnley's relentless pressure, and it left the Chelsea players stunned.

## What's Next for Chelsea?

The draw leaves Chelsea with plenty to think about. The Blues are still in the hunt for a top-four spot, but they will need to improve their ability to close out games if they are to achieve their goal. With several tough fixtures on the horizon, Chelsea will need to regroup and refocus if they are to get their season back on track.

## Conclusion

The 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley was a thrilling encounter that had it all - drama, suspense, and a late twist. While Chelsea will be disappointed with the result, Burnley will be thrilled to have earned a point against one of the Premier League's top teams. As the season enters its final stretch, both teams will be looking to build on this result and achieve their respective goals.
