# Introduction
Arsenal are currently sitting at the top of the Premier League table, four points clear with 12 games to play. However, their recent history of collapsing at the end of the season raises concerns about their ability to maintain their lead.

## The Ghost of Seasons Past
In the 2007-2008 season, Arsenal were in a similar position, leading the league with 12 games to play. However, they went on to win only 5 of their remaining 12 games, ultimately finishing third behind Manchester United and Chelsea. This pattern of collapse has been repeated in subsequent seasons, with Arsenal consistently failing to capitalize on their strong starts.

### The 2013-2014 Season
The 2013-2014 season is another example of Arsenal's end-of-season woes. They were top of the league in February, but a series of poor results saw them finish fourth, 7 points behind champions Manchester City.

## The Current Season
This season, Arsenal have been impressive, with a strong squad and a solid team dynamic. However, their recent history suggests that they may struggle to maintain their lead. The pressure of being top of the league can be intense, and Arsenal's players will need to stay focused if they are to avoid another collapse.

### Key Players
Arsenal's success this season has been built on the performances of key players such as Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, and Martin Odegaard. These players will need to continue to perform at a high level if Arsenal are to maintain their lead.

## The Run-In
The run-in to the end of the season is always crucial, and Arsenal's remaining 12 games will be pivotal in determining their fate. They face tough matches against Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea, and will need to be at their best if they are to come out on top.

### The Opposition
Arsenal's main challengers for the title are Manchester City and Manchester United. Both teams have a strong squad and a wealth of experience, and will push Arsenal all the way to the end of the season.

## Conclusion
Arsenal's recent history of collapsing at the end of the season raises concerns about their ability to maintain their lead in the Premier League. However, this season's squad is strong and well-balanced, and they have a good chance of winning the title. The next 12 games will be crucial, and Arsenal's players will need to stay focused and motivated if they are to avoid another disappointing end to the season.
