# Introduction to the FA Cup Fourth Round
The FA Cup fourth round is upon us, and one of the most exciting matchups is between Hull City and Chelsea. This clash of styles promises to be an intriguing encounter, with Hull City looking to cause an upset against the Premier League giants.

## Recent Form and Performance
Chelsea's recent form has been a mixed bag, with the team showing flashes of brilliance but also struggling with consistency. Their last outing was a lackluster performance, which has been a recurring theme for the Blues this season. On the other hand, Hull City has been performing well in the Championship, with a strong team ethos and a never-say-die attitude.

### The Rosenior Factor
Hull City's current coach, Liam Rosenior, has a unique connection to the club. He was a popular player during his time at Hull and was appreciated for his hard work and dedication. After a downturn in the team's fortunes, Rosenior brought back hope as a coach, but his tenure was cut short by the owner, Acun Ilicali, less than two years ago. This move, although harsh, inadvertently propelled Rosenior upwards, and he is now looking to make a statement against his former team's Premier League counterparts.

## Head-to-Head Analysis
The head-to-head record between Hull City and Chelsea favors the Blues, but the Tigers have caused upsets in the past. Hull City's home advantage could play a significant role in the match, as they look to exploit Chelsea's weaknesses and capitalize on their slackness.

### Key Players to Watch
For Chelsea, players like Kai Havertz and Mason Mount will be crucial in creating scoring opportunities. On the other hand, Hull City will rely on their pacey wingers and target man to cause problems for the Chelsea defense.

## Prediction and Conclusion
The FA Cup is known for its unpredictability, and this match is no exception. While Chelsea is the favorite to win, Hull City has the potential to cause an upset. If the Tigers can exploit Chelsea's weaknesses and maintain their high-intensity pressing game, they might just pull off a surprise victory.

| Team | Formation | Key Players |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hull City | 4-2-3-1 | [Target man], [Winger], [Winger] |
| Chelsea | 3-4-3 | Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, [Defender] |

The stage is set for an exciting encounter between Hull City and Chelsea. Will the Tigers be able to pull off a stunning upset, or will Chelsea's quality and experience prove too much for them? Only time will tell.
