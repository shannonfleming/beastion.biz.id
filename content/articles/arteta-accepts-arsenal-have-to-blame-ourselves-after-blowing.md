# Arsenal's Title Hopes Dented After Wolves Collapse
Mikel Arteta's Arsenal side suffered a devastating blow to their title hopes as they squandered a two-goal lead to draw with bottom side Wolves. The Gunners looked on course for a comfortable victory after goals from Bukayo Saka and Piero Hincapié, but a late equaliser from Tom Edozie in the 94th minute cost them two precious points.

## A Game of Two Halves
The match got off to a perfect start for Arsenal, with Saka and Hincapié scoring to give them a 2-0 lead. However, Wolves refused to give up and managed to pull a goal back through Hugo Bueno. The home side's momentum continued to build, and they eventually equalised in the dying minutes of the game.

### Arteta's Verdict
Mikel Arteta was left to rue his side's missed opportunity, admitting that they 'have to blame ourselves' for the draw. The Arsenal manager stated that his team 'didn't perform at the level required' and that they need to improve if they are to maintain their lead at the top of the Premier League table.

## Title Credentials Questioned
The result has raised concerns over Arsenal's title credentials, with many questioning their ability to close out games. The Gunners are currently five points clear of Manchester City, but have played a game more. With the title race heating up, Arsenal will need to regroup and refocus if they are to maintain their position at the top of the table.

### What's Next for Arsenal?
Arsenal's next match will be a crucial one, as they look to bounce back from this disappointment. They will need to assess their performance and make the necessary adjustments to ensure that they can get back to winning ways. With the Premier League title on the line, every point counts, and Arsenal cannot afford to drop any more points if they are to realise their title ambitions.

## Conclusion
Arsenal's collapse against Wolves has left their title hopes hanging in the balance. While they are still in a strong position, they will need to be more ruthless in their pursuit of victory if they are to maintain their lead at the top of the table. With the pressure mounting, Mikel Arteta and his team will need to dig deep and find the resilience to overcome this setback and push on towards the title.
