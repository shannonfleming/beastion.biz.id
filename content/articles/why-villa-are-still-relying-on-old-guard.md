# Introduction
Aston Villa has been one of the most surprising teams in the Premier League this season, with their experienced players leading the charge. The club's old guard, including players like John McGinn and Ollie Watkins, have taken Villa to new heights, but the question remains: how long can this last?

## The Old Guard
The old guard at Aston Villa is a group of experienced players who have been with the club for several years. These players have been instrumental in Villa's success, providing leadership and guidance to the younger players. John McGinn, for example, has been one of the standout players for Villa this season, scoring crucial goals and providing assists for his teammates. Ollie Watkins has also been in fine form, scoring goals and creating chances for his teammates.

### Experience vs Youth
While the old guard has been instrumental in Villa's success, there is a concern that the club is relying too heavily on these experienced players. The average age of Villa's starting lineup is one of the highest in the Premier League, which raises concerns about the club's long-term sustainability. As the season wears on, the older players may start to tire, and the club may struggle to maintain their current level of performance.

## The Role of Young Players
One of the key factors in determining how long Villa can rely on their old guard is the development of young players. The club has a talented group of young players, including Jacob Ramsey and Cameron Archer, who have been impressive in their limited appearances. However, these players need to be given more opportunities to develop and gain experience if they are to become regular starters for the club.

### Squad Depth
Another factor that will determine how long Villa can rely on their old guard is the depth of their squad. The club has a relatively thin squad, which means that they may struggle to cope with injuries and suspensions. If Villa can strengthen their squad in the transfer market, they may be able to reduce their reliance on the old guard and give more opportunities to younger players.

## The Manager's Dilemma
Aston Villa's manager, Unai Emery, faces a difficult dilemma in terms of how to balance the experience of the old guard with the need to develop younger players. On the one hand, the old guard has been instrumental in Villa's success, and it would be foolish to discard them at this stage. On the other hand, the club needs to think about the long-term future and give opportunities to younger players.

### The Solution
The solution to this dilemma may lie in a combination of both experience and youth. Villa could look to bring in younger players to complement the old guard, rather than replacing them entirely. This would allow the club to maintain their current level of performance while also developing players for the future.

## Conclusion
Aston Villa's reliance on the old guard has taken the club to new heights, but it is unclear how long this can last. The club needs to think about the long-term future and give opportunities to younger players. With a combination of experience and youth, Villa may be able to maintain their current level of performance and achieve long-term success.
