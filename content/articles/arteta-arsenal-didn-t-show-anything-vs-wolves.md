# Introduction
Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Wolves at Molineux Stadium has left manager Mikel Arteta frustrated and disappointed. The Gunners had taken a commanding two-goal lead, but a second-half collapse allowed the home team to snatch a point. In this article, we will analyze the tactical decisions made by Arteta and identify the key factors that contributed to Arsenal's capitulation.

## First-Half Dominance
Arsenal started the game strongly, with their high-intensity press causing problems for the Wolves defense. The Gunners' front three, consisting of Gabriel Martinelli, Eddie Nketiah, and Bukayo Saka, were particularly effective in harassing the Wolves backline and winning the ball back quickly. This approach allowed Arsenal to dominate possession and create scoring opportunities.

### Tactical Breakdown
The Gunners' 4-3-3 formation, with Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka, and Martin Odegaard in midfield, provided a solid foundation for their attacks. The trio controlled the tempo of the game, with Odegaard's creativity and vision causing problems for the Wolves defense. The full-backs, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Ben White, provided width and supported the wingers, allowing Arsenal to stretch the Wolves defense.

## Second-Half Collapse
However, the second half was a different story. Wolves made adjustments to their formation, switching to a 4-2-3-1, which allowed them to gain more control in midfield. The introduction of fresh legs, including Adama Traore and Matheus Nunes, also gave the home team a boost in energy and pace. Arsenal, on the other hand, seemed to lose their intensity and focus, allowing Wolves to dictate the game.

### Arteta's Post-Match Reaction
Mikel Arteta was scathing in his assessment of his team's performance, stating that they 'didn't show anything' in the second half. The manager's criticism was fair, given the manner in which Arsenal surrendered their two-goal lead. Arteta will need to address the issues that led to the collapse, including the team's lack of intensity and focus.

## Conclusion
Arsenal's draw with Wolves has raised concerns about the team's ability to close out games. The Gunners' collapse in the second half was alarming, and Arteta will need to work on his team's mental toughness and resilience. The manager's post-match comments suggest that he is aware of the issues and is willing to take responsibility for the team's performance. As the season enters its final stretch, Arsenal will need to regroup and refocus if they are to achieve their goals.

### Future Prospects
The draw with Wolves has left Arsenal in a precarious position, with several teams still in contention for a top-four spot. The Gunners will need to bounce back from this disappointment and produce a strong run of results to secure their place in the Champions League. With several tough fixtures on the horizon, Arteta's team will need to show their character and determination to overcome the challenges ahead.
