Arne Slot's comment about Liverpool's luck is a testament to the fact that the team has been dealt a tough hand, and it will be interesting to see how they respond to this latest adversity.

## A Historical Context of Liverpool's Injury Woes

The team has consistently been one of the most affected by injuries in the Premier League, with key players like Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino missing significant chunks of the season in recent years. This trend has continued into the current season, with the Jacquet injury being the latest in a long line of setbacks. The team's inability to keep their players fit has been a major factor in their inconsistent form, and it will be crucial for them to find a way to mitigate this issue if they are to achieve their goals.

## Tactical Implications of the Jacquet Injury

| --- | --- | --- |
| Jérémy Jacquet | Defender | 2-3 weeks |

| Roberto Firmino | Forward | 3-4 weeks |
As can be seen from the table, Liverpool are already dealing with a number of injuries, and the Jacquet setback will only add to their woes. The team will need to find a way to adapt to these absences if they are to maintain their position in the league.
