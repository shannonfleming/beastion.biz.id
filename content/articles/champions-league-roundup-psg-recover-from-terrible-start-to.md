# Champions League Roundup: PSG Recover from Terrible Start to Edge Monaco
The Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain overcame a terrible start and a two-goal deficit to beat 10-man Monaco 3-2 in the first leg of their playoff tie.

## A Terrible Start for PSG
PSG conceded a goal in the opening minute and were 2-0 down after 18 minutes as Folarin Balogun grabbed a double for the hosts. The Paris side seemed to be in trouble, but they managed to turn the game around in the second half.

## Désiré Doué: The Game-Changer
Désiré Doué came off the bench to engineer an impressive turnaround for PSG. The 20-year-old replaced the Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembélé, who went off injured after 27 minutes, and proved decisive for the visitors. Doué struck two superb goals and set up one for Achraf Hakimi, helping his team to a 3-2 win.

## Other Champions League Matches
Galatasaray stunned 10-man Juve, while Dortmund beat Atalanta in other Champions League matches. These results have set up some interesting ties for the next round of the competition.

## What's Next for PSG?
PSG will be looking to build on their comeback win when they host Monaco in the second leg of their playoff tie. With a one-goal advantage, the Paris side will be confident of progressing to the next round. However, they will need to be careful not to underestimate their opponents, who showed that they can cause problems with their pace and skill on the counter-attack.

## Conclusion
PSG's comeback win against Monaco was an exciting match that showed the strength and depth of the Paris side. With Désiré Doué emerging as a key player, PSG will be looking to make a deep run in the Champions League this season. The competition is heating up, and fans can expect more thrilling matches in the coming weeks.
