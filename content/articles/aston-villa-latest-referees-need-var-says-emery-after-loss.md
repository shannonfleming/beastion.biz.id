# Introduction
Aston Villa's latest defeat at the hands of Newcastle has left manager Unai Emery frustrated, with the Spaniard calling for greater use of VAR to aid referees in their decision-making. The loss has sparked a wider debate about the role of technology in football, with many questioning whether VAR is being used effectively.

## The Incident
The incident in question occurred during the match between Aston Villa and Newcastle, with Villa players and staff left incensed by a refereeing decision that went against them. Emery's post-match comments highlighted the need for referees to have access to VAR in order to make more accurate decisions.

### Emery's Comments
Emery stated that 'referees need VAR' in order to get decisions right, citing the difficulty of making split-second judgments in high-pressure situations. The Villa manager's comments have sparked a wider discussion about the use of technology in football, with some arguing that VAR is not being used enough, while others believe that it is being over-relied upon.

## The Role of VAR
VAR (Video Assistant Referee) was introduced to the Premier League in the 2019-2020 season, with the aim of reducing errors in refereeing decisions. The system allows referees to review certain decisions, such as goals, penalties, and direct red cards, using video footage.

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Goals | VAR can be used to check if a goal has been scored, including whether the ball has crossed the line and whether there was any infringement |
| Penalties | VAR can be used to check if a penalty has been correctly awarded, including whether there was any contact or infringement |
| Direct Red Cards | VAR can be used to check if a direct red card has been correctly awarded, including whether there was any serious foul play or violent conduct |

## The Challenges of Implementing VAR
Despite its potential to improve refereeing decisions, the implementation of VAR has not been without its challenges. One of the main issues has been the consistency of its use, with some matches seeing multiple reviews, while others see few or none.

### Consistency
The lack of consistency in VAR's use has led to frustration among players, managers, and fans. Emery's comments highlight the need for referees to have access to VAR in order to make more accurate decisions, but the system's use must be consistent and fair.

## Conclusion
The debate surrounding VAR is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. While some believe that VAR is a necessary tool for improving refereeing decisions, others argue that it is being over-relied upon and is disrupting the flow of the game. As the Premier League continues to navigate the use of VAR, it is clear that there is still much work to be done in order to get it right.
