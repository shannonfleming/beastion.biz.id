# Manchester City's Dominant Win Over Fulham Marred by Haaland's Early Exit

Manchester City's week is moving along sweetly, with their latest win closing the gap to three points to Arsenal, who travel to Brentford on Thursday. On Sunday, they defeated Liverpool at Anfield, and on Wednesday, they downed Fulham at home to reel off a 20th consecutive victory against them.

## The Game

The Citizens' dominant performance was a testament to their strength and depth, with Erling Haaland's 39th-minute strike being the highlight of the match. The Norwegian striker's goal was his first in the competition from open play in nine games, and it was a crucial moment in the match. However, more concerning for City fans was Haaland's removal at the break, when City led 3-0.

### Haaland's Injury Concerns

Haaland's early exit has raised concerns about his fitness, with the striker having been struggling with 'niggles' in recent weeks. While the extent of the injury is not yet clear, it is a worrying sign for City fans, who have grown accustomed to Haaland's goalscoring prowess. The striker's absence would be a significant blow to City's title chances, and manager Pep Guardiola will be hoping that the injury is not too serious.

## The Title Race

Despite Haaland's injury concerns, City's win over Fulham has kept them firmly in the title race. The Citizens are now just three points behind leaders Arsenal, who travel to Brentford on Thursday. With several key matches coming up, including a crucial clash against Manchester United, City will need to be at their best if they are to overtake Arsenal and win the title.

### The Road Ahead

City's next few matches will be crucial in determining their title chances. They face a tough test against Manchester United, before taking on Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United. With Haaland's fitness a concern, Guardiola will need to find a way to get the best out of his team, even without their star striker.

## Conclusion

Manchester City's dominant win over Fulham was a testament to their strength and depth, but the injury to Erling Haaland has raised concerns about their title chances. While the Citizens are still firmly in the title race, they will need to be at their best if they are to overtake Arsenal and win the Premier League. With several key matches coming up, City fans will be watching with bated breath as their team navigates the challenges ahead.

| Team | Points | Goal Difference |
