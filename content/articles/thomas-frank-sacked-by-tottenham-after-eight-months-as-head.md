# Introduction
Thomas Frank's tenure as the head coach of Tottenham has come to an end after a mere eight months. The final straw was the defeat at home to Newcastle, a result that left Spurs 16th in the Premier League, five points above the relegation zone.

# The Decline of Tottenham Under Frank
The writing was on the wall for Frank, as Tottenham's performance in the Premier League had been underwhelming. The team's failure to win a single game in 2026 was a major concern, and the defeat to Newcastle was the final nail in the coffin. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium crowd had lost patience with Frank, booing him and chanting that he would be sacked in the morning.

## Tactical Issues
One of the major issues with Frank's tactics was the inability to create scoring opportunities. Tottenham's attack had been stagnant, and the team's reliance on individual brilliance rather than collective effort was a major concern. The midfield was often overrun, and the defense was exposed to counter-attacks.

| Position | Player | Performance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goalkeeper | Hugo Lloris | 6/10 |
| Defender | Cristian Romero | 5/10 |
| Defender | Eric Dier | 5/10 |
| Midfielder | Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg | 6/10 |
| Midfielder | Rodrigo Bentancur | 5/10 |
| Forward | Harry Kane | 7/10 |

# The Future of Tottenham
The sacking of Frank raises questions about the future of Tottenham. The team is in a precarious position, and the new head coach will have a tough task to turn things around. The fans will be expecting a significant improvement in performance, and the board will be under pressure to make the right appointment.

## Potential Replacements
There are several potential replacements for Frank, including former Tottenham players and experienced managers. The board will need to make a decision quickly, as the team's performance in the Premier League is a major concern.

# Conclusion
The sacking of Thomas Frank is a significant development in the world of football. The reasons behind his sacking are clear, and the implications for Tottenham are significant. The team's performance in the Premier League will be under scrutiny, and the new head coach will have a tough task to turn things around. One thing is certain, however - the fans will be expecting a significant improvement in performance, and the board will be under pressure to make the right appointment.
