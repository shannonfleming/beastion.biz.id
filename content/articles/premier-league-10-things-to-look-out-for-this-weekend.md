* Chelsea vs Burnley: Chelsea will be expected to win against Burnley, but the visitors have been known to cause upsets.
* West Ham vs Bournemouth: West Ham will be looking to build on their recent good form, while Bournemouth will be seeking to move away from the relegation zone.

## Key Players to Watch

  + Marco Bizot: The goalkeeper will be looking to redeem himself after his mistake against Newcastle.
* Leeds: 
  + Wirtz: The player has a chance to flummox Forest and cause an upset against Aston Villa.
