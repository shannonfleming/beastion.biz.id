# Introduction
The beautiful game of football has once again been marred by the ugly specter of racism. In the aftermath of the Premier League match between Burnley and Chelsea on Saturday, midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and defender Wesley Fofana were subjected to racist abuse on social media. This disturbing trend has sparked a renewed call to action, with both players speaking out against the vile behavior.

## The Incident
The match between Burnley and Chelsea was a tightly contested affair, with both teams giving it their all on the pitch. However, the real story emerged after the final whistle, when Mejbri and Fofana took to social media to reveal the racist abuse they had received. The messages, which were filled with hate and vitriol, were a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done to eradicate racism from the sport.

### The Players' Response
Mejbri and Fofana, both of whom are of African descent, were quick to condemn the racist abuse they had suffered. In a powerful statement, they called on fans to educate themselves and their children about the dangers of racism. Their message was clear: racism has no place in football, and it is up to all of us to stamp it out.

## The Bigger Picture
The incident involving Mejbri and Fofana is just the latest in a long line of racist incidents to blight the sport. From the monkey chants that have been aimed at black players, to the vile graffiti that has been scrawled on stadium walls, racism has been a persistent problem in football. However, it is not just a problem for the sport; it is a problem for society as a whole.

### The Role of Social Media
Social media has been both a blessing and a curse for football. On the one hand, it has given players a platform to connect with fans and share their thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, it has also provided a conduit for racist abuse to spread. The anonymous nature of social media can make it difficult to track down perpetrators, but it is up to the platforms themselves to do more to prevent racist messages from being posted in the first place.

## Conclusion
The incident involving Mejbri and Fofana is a stark reminder of the work that still needs to be done to eradicate racism from football. It is up to all of us – players, fans, coaches, and administrators – to educate ourselves and our children about the dangers of racism. By working together, we can create a sport that is truly inclusive and welcoming to all. As Mejbri and Fofana so eloquently put it, 'educate yourself and your kids.' The future of football depends on it.
