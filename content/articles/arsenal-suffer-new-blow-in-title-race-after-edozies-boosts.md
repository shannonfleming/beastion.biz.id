# Arsenal's Title Hopes Dented by Wolves' Late Equaliser
Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League table has been reduced to five points after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Wolves at Molineux. The Gunners, who have now won just two of their last seven matches, were unable to capitalise on their dominance and were punished by a late equaliser from Wolves' debutant Tom Edozie.

## A Performance Unworthy of Champions
The match was played on a freezing cold night at Molineux, and Arsenal's performance was just as uninspiring as the weather. The team in red and white failed to produce a display worthy of champions, and will be disappointed with the result. The draw means that Arsenal are now just five points clear of Manchester City, who have been closing the gap in recent weeks.

### A Debut to Remember for Edozie
The equalising goal was scored by Wolves' debutant Tom Edozie, who will never forget his first goal in professional football. The strike was a just punishment for Arsenal's ineptitude, and will be a major confidence boost for the young player. Edozie's goal will also be remembered by the Wolves fans, who were ecstatic with the result.

## The Title Race Heats Up
The result means that the title race is now hotter than ever. Manchester City are just five points behind Arsenal, and will be feeling confident about their chances of catching up. The Citizens have been in impressive form in recent weeks, and will be looking to capitalise on Arsenal's slip-up. The Gunners, on the other hand, will need to regroup and refocus if they are to maintain their lead at the top of the table.

### A Warning Sign for Arsenal
The draw with Wolves is a warning sign for Arsenal, who have been struggling to find their form in recent weeks. The team has won just two of their last seven matches, and will need to improve if they are to win the title. The Gunners have a tough run of fixtures coming up, and will need to be at their best if they are to maintain their lead.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Wolves is a major setback for the Gunners' title hopes. The team's performance was uninspiring, and they were punished by a late equaliser from Wolves' debutant Tom Edozie. The result means that the title race is now hotter than ever, and Arsenal will need to regroup and refocus if they are to maintain their lead at the top of the table.
