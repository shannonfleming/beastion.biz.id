Eberechi Eze has been through a challenging few months, but his recent performance in the FA Cup fourth round against Wigan might just be the catalyst to revitalize his Arsenal career. After being substituted at half-time during the disappointing draw with Brentford, Eze's display against Wigan was a breath of fresh air.
