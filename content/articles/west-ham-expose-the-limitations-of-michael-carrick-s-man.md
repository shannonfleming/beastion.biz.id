# Introduction
Manchester United's recent run of four consecutive wins had raised hopes that the team was turning a corner under the guidance of Michael Carrick. However, Tuesday's draw with West Ham has brought the squad back down to earth, exposing the limitations of Carrick's team.

# The Match
The draw with West Ham was not a bad result, especially considering it was an away game. However, the manner in which Manchester United struggled to break down a packed West Ham defense was concerning. The Hammers' tactics were straightforward - defend deep and in numbers, and look to catch United on the counter-attack. It was a strategy that proved effective, as United struggled to create clear-cut chances.

# Limitations Exposed
The draw with West Ham has highlighted several issues with Manchester United's squad. Firstly, the team's reliance on individual brilliance is a concern. When players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes are not firing, the team struggles to create chances. This was evident against West Ham, as United's attacking play was labored and lacking in creativity.

| Shots on Target | 5 | 3 |
| Corners | 7 | 2 |

The statistics from the match highlight United's dominance in terms of possession and shots on target. However, the fact that they were unable to break down West Ham's defense and create clear-cut chances is a concern.

# Tactical Issues
Michael Carrick's tactics have been questioned in the past, and the draw with West Ham has raised further concerns. The team's inability to adapt to West Ham's defensive strategy was surprising, given the wealth of experience in the United squad. The introduction of fresh players in the second half failed to spark United into life, and the team's attacking play remained stagnant.

# Conclusion
The draw with West Ham has exposed the limitations of Manchester United's squad. While the team has shown signs of improvement under Carrick, the inability to break down packed defenses is a major concern. If United are to challenge for major honors, they need to find a way to overcome these types of teams. The upcoming fixtures will provide a stern test of United's credentials, and it will be interesting to see how the team responds to this setback.

# Future Prospects
The draw with West Ham has not derailed Manchester United's season, but it has highlighted the need for improvement. The team's upcoming fixtures will provide a chance to regain momentum and address the issues that were exposed against West Ham. With the right tactics and a bit of luck, United can still achieve their goals this season. However, the limitations of the squad need to be addressed, and it remains to be seen how Carrick will respond to this challenge.
