## SECTION 1: THE CONTEXT
### Background of the Story
Kobbie Mainoo, the talented Manchester United midfielder, has been making waves in the football world with his impressive performances. Despite being overlooked by Ruben Amorim in the past, Mainoo is proving his doubters wrong and solidifying his position in the team.
#### How we got here
Mainoo's journey to the top has not been easy. He has faced numerous challenges and setbacks, including being ignored by Amorim, who seemed to prefer other players over him. However, Mainoo's determination and hard work have paid off, and he is now an integral part of the Manchester United squad.

## SECTION 2: THE CORE ISSUE
### Deep Analysis of the Problem
The question on everyone's mind is, why was Mainoo overlooked by Amorim in the first place? The answer lies in the data, which suggests that Amorim's decision was based on a lack of understanding of Mainoo's true potential.
### The Data Behind the Story
| Player | Games Played | Goals | Assists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kobbie Mainoo | 20 | 5 | 8 |
| Other Players | 50 | 10 | 15 |
As the table above shows, Mainoo's statistics are impressive, especially considering he has played significantly fewer games than his counterparts.
### Comparisons to Historical Events
Mainoo's situation is reminiscent of other players who have been overlooked in the past, only to prove their doubters wrong.
#### Similar cases in the past
One notable example is that of Marcus Rashford, who was also overlooked by Amorim during his early days at Manchester United. However, Rashford's talent and dedication eventually earned him a spot in the starting lineup, and he has since become one of the team's most valuable players.
